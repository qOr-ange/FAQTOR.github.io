   Asking to work with others is great! But it&rsquo;s important to be clear about
   the plans and what you&rsquo;re offering. This makes it easier for others to
   decide whether they&rsquo;re interested:

<span class="sub-question">
   Asking for an artist?</span> Be clear about the amount of work, price per
   batch, and batch size.
<span class="sub-question">
   Need a programmer?</span> State the hours required or price per task to make
   the offer more appealing.
<span class="sub-question">
   Need a musician?</span> mention the genres and.. you get the point.
<span class="sub-question">
   Asking for free work?</span> It&rsquo;s okay, but be mindful that most people don’t
   want to work for exposure when they could do the same for themselves, let
   alone for actual money.

   It&rsquo;s always helpful to give clear expectations.
   If you&rsquo;re unsure what kind of offer to make, ask in
   a relevant community or channel what people typically expect to be paid for
   specific types of work. This could involve looking at commission sheets or
   discussing general pricing standards. Clear communication goes a long way!
