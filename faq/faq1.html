   If you&rsquo;re stuck on what to build, try combining programming with your
   other interests or hobbies.
</span> 
   Programming can be a powerful tool to explore and enhance things you already love:
   
   <span class="sub-question">Like music?</span> Build a playlist organizer.
   <span class="sub-question">Into fitness?</span> Create a workout tracker.
   <span class="sub-question">Enjoy gaming?</span> Make a small game or a custom tool for a game you play.
   <span class="blurb-text">
   Using programming alongside your passions is a great way to stay motivated
   while learning, and you&rsquo;ll get practical use out of the things you build!</span>
