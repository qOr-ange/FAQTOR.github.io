# OrangeCards FAQ

This repository hosts the OrangeCards website, available at: [qor-ange.github.io/orangecards](https://qor-ange.github.io/orangecards/).

The website features an old-school design with simple HTML, minimal JavaScript, and CSS styling. It serves as a collection of frequently asked questions presented in a clean and accessible format.

Card format theme & structuring (loose) rules:
[Yellow] "Question"
{ 
    [White] - start with important text.
    [Gray] - continiunes with additial information
    [Teal] - end blurb.
    [Green] - resources and sub-questions, details.
             (wildcard, can be under or before end blurb)
}
